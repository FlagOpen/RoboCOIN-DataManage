## What is RoboCOIN DataManager?

RoboCOIN DataManager is a web app that helps you find and download robotic manipulation datasets from the RoboCOIN project. Instead of digging through complex commands, you can browse videos, filter by tags, pick what you need, and get ready-to-use download commands.

## 📋 Important Notice: User Survey

> **To improve user experience, understand user distribution, provide reference for future project development directions, and facilitate better compatibility for users in different regions in the future, we hope you can fill out a relevant information statistics survey before using the RoboCOIN dataset. This statistical information will be collected through official channels of Huggingface or Modelscope, and will not be used for any other purposes except the above. Thank you for your support of the RoboCOIN project!**

  - What room/scene (kitchen, living room, etc.)
  - What robot (Unitree, Agilex, etc.)
  - What action (pick up, place, etc.)
  - What objects (cups, boxes, etc.)
- **Search by name**: Use the search box to find specific datasets

### Step 3: Pick your datasets

- Use "Select all" and "Deselect all" for quick full selection/deselection!
- The counter at the top shows how many datasets you've currently selected

### Step 4: Get download commands
- Look at the "Batch Downloader" panel on the right - all your selected datasets are here!
- Choose your preferred source: HuggingFace or ModelScope
- Click "Copy & Checkout" to copy the Python command

### Step 5: Download the data
1. **First, install RoboCOIN** (one time setup):
   ```bash
   pip install robocoin
   ```
   Pull the corresponding project first: https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboCOIN

2. **Paste and run the command**:
   If needed, you can customize your own download target directory:
